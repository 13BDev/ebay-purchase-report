A Web Extension that generates a compact eBay purchase history report

The eBay purchase history doesn't look friendly when you have tons of purchases and you are interested to see a compact grouped list of what you have purchased, how much it costed, how many shipped or not, etc.
Such a list can be easily generated by traversing the page's DOM and collecting these info and eventually printing out a report at the browser's console.

This project provides a Firefox Web Extension (add-on) that aids in generating such a report. The report is generated in a new tab as a HTML report.

# Requirements

Tested on Linux with Firefox 45+, Chrome 55+, Opera 36+. It should work also on Windows or MacOS. Not tested on Android or iPhone but who knows, it might just work :-)

# Install the add-on

1. Download the Chrome|Opera .crx add-on file or the Mozilla signed .xpi add-on file from [dist](https://github.com/eugenmihailescu/ebay-purchase-report/tree/master/dist) folder
2. Open your browser Tools -> `Extension`|`Add-ons` menu
	2.1 On Firefox on the top-right (near the `Search add-on` input) there is a `tools` drop-down button. Click that button and choose `Install Add-on From File`. Choose the file downloaded at step (1)
	2.2 On Chrome|Opera just drag & drop the .crx file downloaded at (1) over the `Extension` list. It will automatically suggest you to `Drop to install` 

That's all!

# How to use it

1. Open the eBay page and log-in using your eBay account
2. Go to the My eBay -> `Purchase history` menu
3. When the page loads you will notice a golden `Quick Report` button on the Orders group box

4. Click the `Quick Report` button. A new tab will open containing a compact HTML report of your eBay purchase history.

Please note that the report will include only visible items. For instance, if you chose to see only 25 `Orders per page` then the report will include only these orders. To include the whole history make sure you choose the largest `Orders per page` option available (eg. 100).

# Shown columns

By default the report would include the following columns:
 - \# : the index of the report's row
 - Purchase date: the eBay `Order date` information
 - Item price : the eBay `Item price` value
 - Quantity : the eBay quantity for the item
 - Shipping status: the eBay order's item shipping status
 - Estimated delivery: the eBay order's item `Estimated delivery` date, if available
 - Item description : the eBay order's item description as shown on purchase history
 
By default the report would generate a group footer subtotal for each date/currency value. This group footer shows the item count within group, their total amount, how many are shipped/not-shipped and the average price per item.
The report will print also a grand total for the entire report.
 
# Sort ordering

The report is generated by default using the natural order of the purchased items. If you want to sort the report by a given column then click the arrow icon that is shown near the column name. It works both ascendent and descendent. 

# Caveat Emptor

1. Due the fact that the add-on iterates the current shown order items the report will include exactly the items you see in the current `eBay Purchase History` page.
2. If you want to open an item's details page just click the item. The add-on will simulate the click of the respective item within the eBay purchase history page.  
3. While interacting with the report (sorting, opening item details, etc) make sure you dont' close the eBay purchase history tab/page otherwise an error message will be shown. 

# What's Next

1. Make it work also for `Unpaid items`, `Canceled items`, `Canceled invoices` and `Returns and canceled orders` purchase history lists.
