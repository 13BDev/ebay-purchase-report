# ebay-purchase-report
Creates a ad-hoc eBay purchase history report

The eBay purchase history doesn't look friendly when you have tons of purchases and you are interested to see a compact grouped list of what you have purchased, how much it costed, how many shipped or not, etc.
Such a list can be easily generated by traversing the page's DOM and collecting these info and eventually printing out a report at the browser's console.

This project provides a JavaScript code that aids in generating such a report. The report is either a plain-text WYSIWYG report or a JSON compact object. It works very well in FireFox's Scratchpad but it can also be used within modern Chrome or Opera by using some 3rd-party scratchpad-like browser extension.

# How to use it

1. Open your browser's Scratchpad-like tool.
  - In Firefox open the menu Tools -> WebDeveloper -> Scratchpad (Shift + F4).
2. Open the given JavaScript script.js file
  -  in Firefox Scratchpad open the menu File -> Open File (Ctrl + O).
3. Run the Scratchpad's loaded script.
  -  in Firefox Scratchpad open the menu Execute -> Run (Ctrl + R).
4. Open your browser's console ouput and check the logged output. Make sure the JavaScript and Logging output options are activated.

# Report format

The report is generated by default in a plain-text format. If you want to print-out a JSON object instead then just change the script's format parameter to 'object'. If you want to print-out the string version of that object then change the format paramter to 'json'. That's all.

# What's Next

In the nearest future I intend to write a Firefox Extension that would do exactly what this script does with the exception that it would generate a HTML output such that no Scratchpad/console would be required anymore.
